As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">was an absolute mess</a> — and GameStop <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655626/nintendo-switch-2-gamestop-preorder">didn’t fare much better</a> later in the week.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is still <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">there are strict requirements</a>. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites">can’t guarantee an invite</a> ahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, at least at traditional US retailers. Additional preorder inventory has popped up intermittently at Walmart and GameStop in recent days; however, so far, none of the major retailers have announced when they will resume accepting preorders, if at all. That being said, if you’re trying to secure a Switch 2, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success if they re-open.</p>\n\n<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents"><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#retailer-landing-pages">Retailer landing pages</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#what-switch-2-configurations-are-available">What Switch 2 configurations are available?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#a-few-essentials-tips-to-keep-in-mind">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</a><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#create-accounts-for-every-retailer">Create accounts for every retailer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#download-the-mobile-apps">Download the mobile apps</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#sign-up-for-retailer-notifications">Sign up for retailer notifications</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#skip-the-accessories">Skip the accessories</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#try-your-local-brick-and-mortar-store">Try your local brick-and-mortar store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#follow-us-and-others">Follow us (and others)</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2">Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</a><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#my-nintendo-store">My Nintendo Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#walmart">Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#gamestop">GameStop</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#best-buy">Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#target">Target</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#newegg-and-sam-s-club">Newegg and Sam’s Club</a></li></ol></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="retailer-landing-pages">Retailer landing pages</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="what-switch-2-configurations-are-available">What Switch 2 configurations are available?</h2>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest <em>Mario Kart</em> title, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. Nintendo is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641933/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-limited-time-production">on record saying</a> the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick up <em>Mario Kart World</em> separately <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mario-Kart-World-U-S-Version/15940407280">for a whopping $79</a>.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">recently raised the price</a> of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a> and the  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> in response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />\n\n<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="a-few-essentials-tips-to-keep-in-mind">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</h2>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in console preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser">build up an inventory</a> of the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success&nbsp;<em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of when preorders drop next.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="create-accounts-for-every-retailer">Create accounts for every retailer</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase.</p>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8230; most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="download-the-mobile-apps">Download the mobile apps</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sign-up-for-retailer-notifications">Sign up for retailer notifications</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">A couple of retailers, specifically&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-2/424543.html">GameStop</a>,&nbsp;allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.</p>\n<img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Nintendo-Switch-2-Lifestyle-Image-5.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.6,21.305020390944,76.8,60.315078548757" title="" />\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="skip-the-accessories">Skip the accessories</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even a&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">camera accessory for video chats</a>. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="try-your-local-brick-and-mortar-store">Try your local brick-and-mortar store</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">This might come as a surprise in 2025, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 shortly following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — the <a href="http://had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles">GameStop location our own Ash Parrish visited</a>&nbsp;had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="follow-us-and-others">Follow us (and others)</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">As you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory over the next month or so — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th.

We anticipate Amazon opening preorders at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon and other retailers begin offering preorders.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="my-nintendo-store">My Nintendo Store</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers is the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415162056/https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to&nbsp;<em>share</em>&nbsp;gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415162056/https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy">in the privacy section</a>&nbsp;when logged into your account).</p>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account …</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which will begin with the first batch of invitations on May 8th.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, in <a href="http://Nintendo says that due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”">a recent update to its site</a>, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="walmart">Walmart</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Walmart is no longer accepting preorders for the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-System/15949610846/">standalone Switch 2</a> ($449) or the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/15928868255/"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> ($499), though you can still preorder games like <em><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-U-S-Version/15949810208/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> ($69) and accessories like the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-Carrying-Case-Screen-Protector/15955005002?classType=REGULAR">Switch 2 Carrying Case &amp; Screen Protector</a> ($39.88). That being said, Walmart’s website&nbsp;still indicates that, if you manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="gamestop">GameStop</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">GameStop currently isn’t accepting preorders for the <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-2/424543.html">standalone console</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch-2/products/nintendo-switch-2-console-and-mario-kart-world-bundle/424542.html"><em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/switch-2-buyers-hold-on-to-your-original-switch-the-resale-is-not-worth-it-2000592660">confirmed to <em>Gizmodo</em></a> that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.</p>\n\n<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="best-buy">Best Buy</h3>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Best Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-system-multi/6614313.p">standalone console</a> or the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-multi/6614325.p"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> right now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/clp-video-games/nintendo-member-offer/pcmcat1742915358934.c?id=pcmcat1742915358934">excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware</a>).

But a DOJ lawyer pointed out that Google’s letters attempting to amend its deal with phone makers, which the company presented at the hearing, were only sent last week, just ahead of the trial. Also, internal slides presented today apparently showed that Google “was considering more restrictive &nbsp;distribution agreements that would have required partners to preinstall Gemini alongside Search and Chrome,” <em>The Information</em> writes.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Fitzgerald said the Gemini deal is a two-year agreement that, along with fixed monthly payments, sees Google giving Samsung a percentage of its subscription revenue for the Gemini app. Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyer David Dahlquist called the fixed monthly payment an “enormous sum,” <em>Bloomberg </em>says.

In recent days, Martin has sent letters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/health/nejm-prosecutor-letter.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">to the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/us-attorney-demands-scientific-journal-explain-ensures-viewpoint-diver-rcna201929"><em>CHEST Journal</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/medical-journals-complain-harassment-department-justice-rcna203091#:~:text=A%20third%20journal%2C%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynecology%2C%20confirmed%20to%20NBC%20News%20it%20also%20received%20a%20letter%20from%20Martin.%C2%A0"><em>Obstetrics and Gynecology</em></a>, accusing them of being “partisan in various scientific debates.”</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Martin asks the Wikimedia Foundation to respond to several questions, such as what it’s doing to “safeguard” the public from propaganda, as well as efforts to exclude “foreign influence operatives from making targeted edits” on topics that would “reshape or rewrite history.” He’s giving the Foundation until May 15th to respond.</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">“Wikipedia&#8217;s content is governed by three core\xa0<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">content policies</a>:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">\xa0neutral point of view</a>,\xa0<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">verifiability</a>, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">\xa0no original research</a>, which exist to ensure information is presented as accurately, fairly, and neutrally as possible,” Jacob Rogers, the Wikimedia Foundation’s associate general counsel, said in an emailed statement to <em>The Verge</em>.\xa0“The entire process of content moderation is overseen by nearly 260,000 volunteers and is open and transparent for all to see, which is why we welcome opportunities to explain how Wikipedia works and will do so in the appropriate forum.”</p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">Martin’s letter reflects a broader trend of the right targeting Wikipedia. Last year, Elon Musk <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/elon-musk-and-the-rights-war-on-wikipedia/?ref=404media.co">told supporters to</a> “stop donating to Wokepedia” <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/wikipedia_musk_right_trump.php">before later calling the site</a> “an extension of legacy media propaganda.” In January, <a href="http://forward.com">a report from <em>Forward.com</em></a> found that The Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025, created a presentation with a series of slides geared toward “targeting” Wikipedia editors. </p>\n\n<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wikimedia Foundation has since created tools to protect the identities of editors, with CEO Maryana Iskander telling the community that it’s “seeing an increase in threats, both regulation and litigation across the world,” <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-prepares-for-increase-in-threats-to-us-editors-from-musk-and-his-allies/">as reported by <em>404 Media</em></a>.</p>'}]}], 'feed': {'language': 'en-US', 'title': 'The Verge', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en-US', 'base': 'https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml', 'value': 'The Verge'}, 'subtitle': 'The Verge is about technology and how it makes us feel.
